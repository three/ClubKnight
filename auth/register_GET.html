        <h1>Register for Club RU</h1>

        <h2>Before you register</h2>

        <h3>Who can register?</h3>
        <p>Students of Rutgers University, 18 years of age or older.</p>

        <h3>What do I need to register</h3>
        <p>To register you need your Rutgers netId. An email will be sent to
        <em>netid</em>@scarletmail.rutgers.edu with a confirmation code. Or
        that's what's supposed to happend once we're done. In the game you will
        be identified by your netId.</p>

        <h3>Am I anonymous?</h3>
        <p>Nobody is anonymous when using Club RU. Each student is identified by
        their netID.</p>

        <h3>Can I be banned?</h3>
        <p>Short of legal concerns (you must obey the law), we do not ban people.</p>

        <h3>Do you value your user's privacy?</h3>
        <p>The ClubRU team recognizes the importance of keeping users informed
        what data we collect and how we use it. For this reason, we have included
        many questions on this page with the purpose of answering those questions.
        This does NOT necessarily mean we are conservative or careful about the
        data we do collect, so please read the ENTIRE page and email us if you
        have additional questions (eric AT threedot14.com).

        <h3>What do you log?</h3>
        <p>The information we log from the server changes depending on how much we have
        the capacity to log and what we feel we must log to improve ClubRU. We
        always log all chat interactions. If you are a user of ClubRU it is
        safest to assume all your online interactions will be logged.</p>

        <h3>How long do you store logs?</h3>
        <p>We currently do not have routines to regularly delete log files. Log
        files may be deleted when space becomes low. If you are a user of
        ClubRU it is safest to assume log files will be stored forever.</p>

        <h3>Do you sell any data you collect?</h3>
        <p>ClubRU will NEVER sell any data we collect.</p>

        <h3>Do you cooperate with police?</h3>
        <p>We do not have an official policy for cooperating with police. We
        will always cooperate with the police if the law requires we do so.
        This may include providing access logs, chat logs, or any other data
        collected and stored by our server. Additionally, there have been cases
        where police have seized control of servers, giving them the ability
        to collect or ask for additional information. If you are a user of
        ClubRU it is safest to assume we will fully cooperate with the police.
        </p>

        <h3>Is ClubRU open source?</h3>
        <p>The source for ClubRU is publicly available on our
        <a href="https://github.com/three/ClubRU/">Github Repo</a>, however we
        have not yet chosen a proper license to be considered "open source".</p>

        <h3>Are you accepting contributions?</h3>
        <p>Yes! Please follow the contributing guidelines on our Github repo.</p>

        <h3>How are passwords stored?</h3>
        <p>Your passwords are salted and hashed using argon2.</p>
        
        <h3>How do I change my password?</h3>
        <p>Come back to this page and enter your netId and new password.
        Once you confirm the password change via email, we will update
        our database to reflect it.</p>

        <h3>Are you affiliated with Rutgers?</h3>
        <p>Club RU is made by a team of Rutgers students but is NOT
        affiliated in any way with the University. We run independently
        of Rutgers University.</p>

        <h3>What else do I need to know?</h3>
        <p>Don't do anything illegal. Also (TODO), probably a bunch more
        legal stuff we should probably add.</p>
